Version: 5.1.6
  Changes:
    - Fixed duplication bug with bobs plates, hopefully doesn't mess up compatibility with other mods.
	- Added toggle for recycling vehicles and power armors (off by default)
	- Added changelog.txt for a prettier changelog (many thanks to SuperSandro2000)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.1.3
  Changes:
    - Improved compatibility with angels refining and bio industries.
	- Prevents crushed stone duplication in recyclers.
	- Allows bio industries terraformer to be recycled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.1.2
  Changes:
    - Potential final bugfix for rf-recipe related errors
	- Small fix to safety toggle so it applies to normal/expensive recipes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.1.1
  Changes:
    - Minor bugfix for angel's smelting
	- If angel's smelting detected, uses advanced invar processing instead of invar ally processing as a dependency for recycling machine t2
	- Prevents crushed stone duplication in recyclers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 5.1.0
  Changes:
    - Massive rewrite of core mod
	- Recyclers come in 2 tiers; t1 can recycle into solids only, and t2 can recycle into solids and fluids
	- Recycler icons now use powerbars, edited from Zombiee's ShinyBobGFX mod
	- T1 recycler is easier to research, requiring only red science, electronics and automation
	- T1 recipe requires more resources (2 t1 assemblers and green circuits) and is marginally slower, but retains its 2 module slots
	- T2 recycler is harder to craft and research, requiring steel, red circuits, and 2 t2 assemblers
	- T2 recycler is almost twice as fast as before, with 4 module slots
	- Recyclers adhere to new normal/expensive mode, dynamically changing reverse recipes accordingly
	- Recyclers require alloy processing from bobs mods if detected (bronze for t1, invar for t2)
	- Recyclers output slots will stretch to fill the largest ingrediant amount in the game (5 and 7 for vanilla, roughly 10 and 12 for bobs mods)
	- Added new safety toggle, which prevents the recycling of dense recipes (on by default; disable to remove the restriction, though any ingredients above their stack limit will be deleted)
	- Removed redundant settings (normal/expensive difficulty toggle, and dynamic uncrafting toggle), implemented into core mod
	- Automatic Ingredient push setting still exists and works with new tier of recycler, though it may not migrate properly with existing games; any existing recyclers should be upgraded into t2's

This is a test to see if markdown works from a txt file, but I doubt it. Makes hyperlinks a bit more annoying, but oh well. Such is the price of beauty
