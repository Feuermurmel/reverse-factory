rf-compati=Automatic ingredient push
rf-delay=Auto ingredient push delay
rf-timer=Auto ingredient push timer
rf-vehicles=Recyclable power armor/vehicle
rf-efficiency=Recycling efficiency
rf-prod-loop=Disable productivity loop

[mod-setting-description]
rf-compati=UNTESTED for multiplayer, please disable if having desyncs. Pushes items to the output slot if input count does not match original crafting count. EX: 1 underground belt can not be recycled; pushed to output after a short delay
rf-delay=How long to wait in between checks for the auto ingredient push. Lower values run more often, but make the timer more accurate. Default to 60 (1 second).
rf-timer=How long to wait before pushing the stopped ingredients to the output slot. Default to 180 (3 seconds). Lower values will push the ingredients more quickly (less downtime).
rf-vehicles=When enabled, allows the recycling of vehicles and power armor. Please remember to empty trunk items and equipments before recycling or those items/equipments will be lost.
rf-efficiency=Efficiency of recycling recipes. Default to 100%.
rf-prod-loop=Disables a potential exploit involving productivity recycling loop, which prevents recycling of most intermediate products.
