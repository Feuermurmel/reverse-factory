reverse-factory=Realistic Reverse Factory

[technology-description]
reverse-factory=The Realistic Reverse Factory can disassemble the most of items in a realism purpose and get back the ressources you needed to create those items. It's "realistic" mod so you can't get back fluids if you needed fluids for the creation of the item you want to disassemble.

[mod-setting-name]
rf-dynamic=Allow dynamic uncrafting
rf-difficulty=Set difficulty level

[mod-setting-description]
rf-dynamic=Due to Factorio recipe changes, recipes with regular and expensive variants show up in the player crafting menu if attempting to create dynamic reverse recipes (eg: play hard mode, get hard mode reverse recipes, not regular)
rf-difficulty=When dynamic uncrafting is disabled, set difficulty override here (true=vanilla, false=hard). Reverse recipes will be set to either regular or expensive variants, regardless of actual in-game difficulty. Also removes unnecessary group from player crafting menu.
